### 🔐 CODEOWNERS
* Each contributor **owns their own folder**.
* Permissions are managed using **CODEOWNERS**.
* You can freely edit, add, or remove files **inside your own directory**.

## 📝 How to use
Follow this workflow when contributing code:
1. **Enter your own folder**: Add new solutions or update existing ones.

2. **Commit your changes**: Write clear commit messages (what you solved / updated).

3. **Create a new branch**: You can't commit directly to `main`.

4. **Open a Pull Request**: Wait for review and verification.

5. **Merge after approval**: Once merged successfully, **delete the branch**.
